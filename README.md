# CORE is an toolkit to generate compact and relaxable answers to keyword queries over knowledge graphs.
========================================================
/core/src contains the code of the whole project.<br>
/core/lib contains the libraries that the code is dependent on.<br>
/core/ExampleGraph.pdf is an example entity-relation graph.<br>
/core/example/ExampleTriples is the source data of the example.<br>
/core/core.jar is the runnable jar file. To run the example correctly, you have to put the example folder and core.jar in the same directory.

To get an answer, you may wish to run 'java -jar core.jar'

We also provide the simulated queries in the /core/query folder, including 438 queries for DBpedia, 200 queries for LinkedMDB, and 40 queries for MONDIAL.
